# Reddit big data
## Ethan Harlig, Collin Dutter, Luke Smith

This project aims to analyze Reddit data using distributed systems. The analysis of this data should result in providing insight into:
* The best time to post on Reddit to optimize upvotes
* The best time to post on Reddit to optimize comments
* The subreddit to post in which will generate the most upvotes
* And more
